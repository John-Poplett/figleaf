# figleaf

figleaf is a minimalist code coverage utility for Clojure
layered on top of the the clojure.test unit test framework. It's pretty basic
and only analyzes function coverage. It doesn't analyze coverage by
statement or condition / decision logic. Despite its limitations, it's
still quite useful and easy to use.

figleaf is based on and structured similarly to cl-figleaf, an earlier
implementation for Common Lisp.

## Usage

(use 'figleaf.core)
