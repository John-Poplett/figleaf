#+TITLE: Figleaf TODO
#+AUTHOR: John Poplett

* TODO Blacklist
Extend APIs and implement a way for calling code to exempt certain
functions from instrumentation.
* TODO Self-analysis
Eliminate infinite recursion in figleaf.core so figleaf can instrument
and report code coverage stats for its own unit tests. May not be
readily feasible or worthwhile.
* TODO Binding / =with-redefs=
Examine the use of binding or =with-redefs= as an alternative to
alt-var-root for the =with-instrument-namespace= macro.
* TODO Figleaf Leiningen plugin
+ Improve integration with Leiningen so the plugin instruments a
  complete project in one fell swoop.
+ Add option to emit a list of untested functions
