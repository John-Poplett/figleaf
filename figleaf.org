* Introduction
figleaf is a minimalist code coverage utility for Clojure, layered on
top of the [[http://richhickey.github.com/clojure/clojure.test-api.html][clojure.test]] unit test framework. It's based on cl-figleaf,
a similar implementation for Common Lisp. figleaf is pretty basic and
only analyzes function coverage. It doesn't analyze coverage by
statement or condition / decision logic. Despite its limitations, it's
still quite useful and easy to use.

It can help you identify functions or macros that aren't tested.
Conversely, untested functions sometimes indicate functions that are
out-dated and safe to remove.

Figleaf instruments a namespace so that it can count the number of times
the macros and functions of that namespace are called. When unit tests
are executed, the function calls are recorded. At the end of the unit
test run, the counts are reported to the console.

Figleaf is conveniently invoked from a Clojure REPL or as a Leiningen task.

From the REPL, one can invoke the =run-tests= function:

=user> (run-tests unitstat unitstat.tests)=

=run-tests= will execute the tests defined in the namespace
=unit-test-namespace= on an instrumented version of
=namespace-under-test=. At the end of the run, the results are printed
to standard output.

By design, these look like they are part of a standard clojure.test
summary.

Another useful function is =figleaf:untested= which returns a list
of functions that were not called by any unit test. The complementary
function is =tested= which will return all of the functions that were
called.

* Future
Figleaf has been qualified with Clojure 1.3 and the clojure.test test
framework. In the future, it might be extended to provide function
profiling and other useful features.
